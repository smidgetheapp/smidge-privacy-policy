<h1>Privacy Policy for Smidge</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 24, 2025</p>
<p>Smidge (“the App”) is a tool for organizing and browsing content. It is designed to provide users with quick access to current news, headlines, and web content from user-selected websites. The App permits users to customize and organize content into easy-to-navigate categories and lists. Smidge combines modern scrolling and swiping navigation with lightweight previews, allowing users to glance at content before permitting them to open it in their default browser. Smidge is not designed to function as a standalone web browser and does not track or collect browsing histories.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Information</strong> — <em>Email Address &amp; Password</em> via Firebase Authentication (passwords handled securely by Firebase; never visible to us).</li>
  <li><strong>User Content</strong> — <em>Categories &amp; Saved Pages</em> stored in Firebase Firestore to sync across devices.</li>
  <li><strong>We do not collect</strong> browsing history within third-party sites, search queries made on third-party sites, or advertising identifiers. We do not sell your data and do not use third-party advertising SDKs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and maintain your account and basic App functionality</li>
  <li>Save and sync your categories and saved pages across devices</li>
  <li>Improve reliability, performance, and user experience (in aggregate, not tied to your personal browsing)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Sharing &amp; Processing</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong>: Authentication and data storage; data may be processed on servers outside your country.</li>
  <li><strong>No Sale or Rental of Data</strong>: We do not sell, rent, or share your data with advertisers or marketers.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Aside from Firebase, we do not use additional processors that access personal data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Retention</strong>: Account data (email, categories, saved pages) is retained while your account is active.</li>
  <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: You can delete your account any time in the App; this permanently removes associated data from Firestore.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Free Trial &amp; Future Subscription</h2>
<p>Smidge is currently offered as a free trial. In the future, we may introduce a subscription model if it better aligns with supporting ongoing development and permitting the App to remain focused on delivering an ad-free and privacy-respecting experience.</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Smidge is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly.</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All communications use HTTPS encryption in transit.</li>
  <li>Firebase provides encryption at rest for stored data.</li>
  <li>We never store plaintext passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite safeguards, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We work to protect your information and continually improve our practices.</p>
