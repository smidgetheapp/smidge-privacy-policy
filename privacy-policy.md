Privacy Policy for Smidge
Effective Date: August 24, 2025
Smidge (“the App”) is a tool for organizing and browsing content. It is designed to provide users with quick access to current news, headlines, and web content from user-selected websites. The App permits users to customize and organize content into easy-to-navigate categories and lists. Smidge combines modern scrolling and swiping navigation with lightweight previews, allowing users to glance at content before permitting them to open it in their default browser. Smidge is not designed to function as a standalone web browser and does not track or collect browsing histories.
1. Information We Collect
We collect only the minimum information necessary to operate the App:
Account Information
Email Address & Password: Used to create and sign in to your account via Firebase Authentication. Passwords are handled securely by Firebase and are never visible to us.

Categories & Saved Pages: Your chosen categories and the websites you save are stored in your account using Firebase Firestore so they can sync across your devices.
We do not collect
Browsing history within websites you visit through the App
Search queries made on third-party sites
Advertising identifiers for targeted ads
We do not sell your data and we do not use third-party advertising SDKs.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the above information to:
